# Mobility Project
Interdisciplinary Project in Data Science (with Department of Transport and Mobility) @ TU Wien

This project seeks to analyze lyrics from top-charting songs over the recent years to uncover trends in references to various modes of transport (e.g., walking, cycling, train, bus, plane). 
It will be focused on developing and evaluating methods for the accurate identification of transportation-related entities, as this is the foundational step for any further analysis. Additional experiments will be considered if sufficient accuracy in entity recognition is achieved.
